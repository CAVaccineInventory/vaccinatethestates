## How to begin local development on a Mac

### Set up Ruby 2.7

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it
2. `brew install ruby-install chruby`
3. Add the following to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
```
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
```
4. `ruby-install ruby 2.7.2`

### Set up Node 15.8.0

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) if you don't already have it
2. `nvm install 15.8.0`

### Start local development server
```
script/server
```

### First time with Jekyll?

- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby-based static site generator. It is easy to pick up if you've worked in Ruby before.
  - You'll see [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating used a lot.
  - Jeykll starts on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) by default.
    - You will need to restart the Jekyll process when the config file changes; that is the only time you need to restart it _most_ of the time. (Other occasions include adding collections, etc, which you'll be doing extremely infrequently.)

### Running the linter
The linter - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - runs on every PR automatically. If you'd like to run it locally, run `npm install` once to set up npm and then `npm run lint:fix` to run the linter.
