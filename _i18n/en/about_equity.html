    evidence</a> indicates that, despite being more severely affected by the
    covid-19 pandemic, members of marginalized communities have received
    disproportionately fewer vaccines than those with more resources.

    Vaccinate The States is committed to ensuring that those with historical
    disadvantages have equitable access to all the information we report. By
    partnering with experts and advocates who have demonstrated trust with their
    communities, we hope to develop tools that support the real needs of those
    most impacted by the crisis.
