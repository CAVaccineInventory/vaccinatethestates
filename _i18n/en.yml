about_intro: |
    Vaccinate The States is a non-profit, non-partisan, community-driven effort that helps Americans
    learn accurate, up-to-date information about how to get the coronavirus vaccine. We are building
    the most comprehensive list of vaccination sites in the United States.
about_how_we_work_title: How We Work
about_how_we_work: |
    Our team calls medical professionals at hundreds of potential vaccination sites
    daily to ask them if they are offering vaccinations and how to get an
    appointment. We also gather vaccine site information from official sources,
    including VaccineFinder.org, state government agencies, county health
    departments, and healthcare providers. We compile what they say into a
    comprehensive map, and make it freely available on this site, to other
    publishers, and to public health initiatives.

faq_accurate_answer: |
    <p class="mb-2"> We publish only what we have collected from official sources or direct phone
    calls to vaccination sites. The situation is complicated and changes rapidly.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Our efforts are relied upon by governmental entities and some of the largest
    publishers in the world.</p>
    <p>While we make substantial efforts to be accurate, we can't guarantee the current accuracy of
    everything published.</p>
