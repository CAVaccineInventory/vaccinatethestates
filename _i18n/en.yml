    Vaccinate The States is a non-profit, non-partisan, community-driven effort that helps Americans
    learn accurate, up-to-date information about how to get the coronavirus vaccine. We are building
    the most comprehensive list of vaccination sites in the United States.
about_how_we_work_title: How We Work
about_how_we_work: |
    Our team calls medical professionals at hundreds of potential vaccination sites
    daily to ask them if they are offering vaccinations and how to get an
    appointment. We also gather vaccine site information from official sources,
    including VaccineFinder.org, state government agencies, county health
    departments, and healthcare providers. We compile what they say into a
    comprehensive map, and make it freely available on this site, to other
    publishers, and to public health initiatives.

faq_org: I work in a community-facing organization or for the government. Can we discuss this?
faq_accurate: Is the information on this website accurate?
faq_accurate_answer: |
    <p class="mb-2">We rely primarily on official sources or direct phone calls to vaccination
    sites. We also use unofficial sources where we believe they provide accurate information about
    vaccination clinics not available from other sources.. The situation is complicated and changes
    rapidly; even official sources are sometimes incorrect or out-of-date.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Our efforts are relied upon by governmental entities and some of the largest
    publishers in the world.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">While we make substantial efforts to provide the most accurate, up to date
    information available to us, we can't guarantee the current accuracy of everything
    published.</p>
